"""
Helper program to generate the mileage table array from a list of cities

Will prompt you for number of city, names of cities, and mileages
and will spit out C code for you to copy and paste

There is no error checking -- be sure that
the number of cities and the mileages are positive ints.

This assumes that the distance between two cities doesn't depend on the order of
the cities -- modify main to pass a False to get_mileages if that's not true.
